        <p><em>Already a hit last summer, these grapes will provide plenty of refreshment again this year.</em></p>
        <p></p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <p><em>For 4 persons / 15 Minutes</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>300 g Seedless grapes</li>
                <li>40 g Sugar</li>
                <li>50 ml Water (or sparkling wine)</li>
                <li>some lime juice</li>
                <li>some Tajín spice (depending on preference)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Before "marinating" the grapes, wash them thoroughly and pat them dry.</li>
                <li>Then mix the water, sugar – alternatively, sparkling wine is also suitable as a fancy substitute for water – and a dash of lime juice in a separate bowl and toss the grapes in it.</li>
                <li>Depending on taste, the still slightly moist grapes can be rolled in a mixture of sugar and Tajín spice before freezing until they are evenly coated.</li>
                <li>Then spread the marinated grapes on a plate or baking tray lined with baking paper – preferably so that they do not touch. Then place in the freezer and leave to chill for at least four hours, ideally overnight.</li>
                <li>When the fruits are frozen, they can be enjoyed as a light summer or party snack.</li>
            </ol>

                <li>1 teaspoon Chili powder</li>
                <li>Ripe mangoes, peeled and diced (or 300g frozen mango, defrosted)</li>
                <li>Chicken thigh or breast without skin and bones, cut into 3 cm pieces</li>
                <li>Fresh coriander, stalks chopped and leaves saved for garnish</li>
                <li>Juice of Â½ lime</li>
                <li>Fish sauce (optional)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion and gently fry until soft and translucent, about 7 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and fry for a further 2 to 3 minutes. Finally, add the chilli powder, coriander, cumin, turmeric, salt and pepper and cook for a further 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add half the mango and cook for another minute, stirring constantly , then add the coconut milk. Bring quickly to the boil and then simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes. Then carefully pour the sauce into a blender and puree until completely smooth. Return to the pan and simmer again over a low heat.</li>
                <li>Stir in the chicken, cover the pan with a lid and cook for about 15 minutes (breasts should be ready after just 7 minutes). If the sauce sticks to the bottom of the pan, add a little water. Stir in the remaining mango pieces as soon as the chicken is cooked through.</li>
                <li>Season to taste with chopped coriander stalks, lime juice and fish sauce. Serve the curry with cooked rice and garnish with additional coriander leaves.</li>
            </ol>

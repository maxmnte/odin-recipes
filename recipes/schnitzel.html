            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <p class="caption"><em>For 4 persons / 45 Minutes</em></p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>3 piece(s) dried or hard, stale Kaiser rolls</li>
                <li>4 veal schnitzels from special-fed bob veal calves, 5.5 oz. (160 g) each, a quarter inch thick (or 8 veal loin schnitzels, 3 oz. (80 g) each, a quarter inch thick). The veal should be matured for at least 2 weeks.</li>
                <li>1 cup(s) all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>3 eggs</li>
                <li>1 cup(s)canola oil for frying</li>
                <li>2 cup(s) clarified butter for frying</li>
                <li>2cup(s) lard (the amount of fat always depends on the size of the pan)</li>
                <li>1 lemon, untreated</li>
                <li>1 1/4 cup(s) salt</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol class="list ol">
                <li>Make the breadcrumbs yourself from the dried rolls. Sift half of the breadcrumbs a little more coarsely than the other half. Then mix.</li>
                <li>Cover the schnitzels with cling film and flatten them slightly. Then remove the film, salt them on both sides and bread them in the Viennese style (immediately before frying): Shake off the flour well, don’t beat the eggs until uniform, and press on the breadcrumbs very lightly.</li>
                <li>In a tall, thick-walled pan, heat the fat mixture to approx. 285 °F (140 °C). Place the schnitzels in the pan and immediately increase the heat to up to 350 °F (180 °C), continuously swirling the pan. After the first 30 seconds, turn without piercing the meat, then continue to sauté and  swirl until the schnitzel is a deep, golden yellow.</li>
                <li>Carefully remove the schnitzels with a spatula, allow the fat to drain and thoroughly dry off with a paper towel. Cut the lemon into 6 wedges and individually wrap them in 8 by 8 inch size lemon wraps.</li>
                <li>Serve with potato and lamb‘s lettuce salad</li>
